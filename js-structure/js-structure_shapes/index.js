import { getRandomColor } from "./utils/randomColor.js";
import { Circle, circleElement } from "./components/Circle/Circle.js";
import { Square, squareElement } from "./components/Square/Square.js";
import { Pentagon, pentagonElement } from "./components/Pentagon/Pentagon.js";
console.clear();
const root = document.getElementById("root");

// root.append(circle, square, pentagon);

/*Create components
Now refactor the JavaScript code so that we can split the code into small Components.

wrap the creation of the circle element including the addEventListener into a separate function starting with a capital letter, e.g. Circle
after the element is created and all modifications are applied, return the element
call the function and save the returned value a variable, e.g. circleElement
append the element to the root element.
The circle should now be visible as before. Now we need to outsource the component into its own file.

create a file Circle.js inside the Circle folder
move the component function inside this file and export it as the default.
import the component function inside the index.js.
ðŸ’¡ Hint: If the circle doesn't show up, you might need to move some imports into the Circle component as well.

Now repeat the previous steps for the square and the pentagon.*/
